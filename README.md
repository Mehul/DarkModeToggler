# DarkModeToggler

DarkModeToggler is a lightweight Windows tray utility designed to simplify toggling the systemâ€™s dark mode setting. Instead of navigating through multiple settings pages or relying on scheduled tasks, this tool provides a quick, one-click solution directly from the tray.

## Overview

Developed from a personal need for easy dark mode control, DarkModeToggler was prototyped in about an hour using Claude sonnet 3.7 on a free tier. This project not only addresses a common inconvenience but also demonstrates how AI-assisted development can rapidly deliver practical solutions.
